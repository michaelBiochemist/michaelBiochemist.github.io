This monday we will talk about perhaps the most influential libertarian author, Ayn Rand and her philosophy of Objectivism. What is it that makes this philosophy unique among others? According to the objectivist, how should the individual conduct himself in order to have the happiest life? Why is egoism better than altruism? All these questions and more this week!
