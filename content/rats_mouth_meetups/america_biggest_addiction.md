I'm sure you know the feeling of waking up in the morning, a little groggy, wishing you had more energy, but they just don't carry meth at the grocery store! So you go for the next best thing, and swig down a few large cups of coffee. Then it's the afternoon. You're feeling a little weary, so you down a few more, until you're SHAKING with energy. But is caffeine the miracle-maker that gives us energy for free. 

We're not that lucky.
