This week we will be talking about hypnosis and something dubbed "Neuro-Linguistic Programming." ... Now you may be asking the question "Did Mike fall of the deep end?" The answer is "yes." Yes, I did indeed fall off the deep end. Nevertheless, we've all heard stories of people improving their memory, comfortably enduring surgery without anesthetic, and other feats by tapping into the powers of the unconscious, that hypnotists seem to elicit. And we've also seen/heard stories of hypnotists exerting extreme power and influence over their subject's memories, perceptual experiences, physical abilities and emotions. 

Come join us so we can explore the veracity of these claim together. As an added bonus, I will teach you a fun way, inspired by NLP, to tell when someone is lying. This I can say I tested myself, and is quite fun. See you there!
