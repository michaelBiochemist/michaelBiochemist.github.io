This week we'll be talking about marginal utility, or as Jeffrey Tucker puts it, the secret to a happy life. Marginal utility deals with the act of making a single economic decision within a context, and how the context of future decisions is shaped by the first. 

And we'll discuss the question, what stuff could we forego that might actually improve our lives?
Or not. 
He who dies with the most toys wins.
