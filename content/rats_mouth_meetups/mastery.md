We all want to be the best at something. Unfortunately, we've also all had the experince of bumbling around, figuring something out, until we hit a plateau, with no clear idea how to get past it. Sometimes we've even given up on an endeavor thinking that we have no talent for it. For instance, I don't play basketball. 

But if there is something you'd like to master that you had given up on, or if there's something you're good at but don't know how to reach that next level, this meetup is for you! We will be talking about the work of Anders Ericcson, the master on becoming the master.
