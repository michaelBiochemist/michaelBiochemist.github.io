As you drive from the box that the government declares is your home, to the cubicle at your government-approved office company, to receive your paycheck with the income taxes taken out before you even get to see them, I want you to remember something. You. You personally, are descended from people who packed up everything and moved to a completely foreign country in the hopes of forging a better life. 

Not only that, but for our ancient ancestors this was common. Homo sapiens have existed on this planet for roughly 200,000 years. The agricultural revolution happened 10,000 years ago, and was not universally adopted even in the 1800s. What did these cultures do before the laborious process of farming grain trapped them on solitary plots of land? They were hunter gatherers. That's right, we descend from a long and ancient line of nomads. 

When your most recent ancestors made this journey, they called their destination "America." Perhaps you try to honor their sacrifice by being the model citizen. Perhaps you try by doing everything you can to make your new country better. But, as the deal gets worse and worse for you, i invite you to consider that perhaps the best way to honor the sacrifices of your ancestors isn't by staying put, but by taking your turn in the long line of nomads to hunt for greener pastures.
