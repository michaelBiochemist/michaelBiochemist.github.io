This week we are going to talk about one of the greatest creations of humanity, and possibly one of it's most dangerous: artificial intelligence, or within that field is called "machine learning." Here are some of the questions we will attempt to address this week: 

- What are the powers and advantages that come from teaching computers to do things that they are not explicitly programmed?

- What are the dangers of this technology in general? Is there a real threat of our children becoming too smart for us?

- What are the consequences of allowing this pandoras box to sit in the hands of statists, collectivists and government? If they are too dire, what steps can we take to ensure that we have our own learning machines who serve our interests, and not the interests of our political masters.
