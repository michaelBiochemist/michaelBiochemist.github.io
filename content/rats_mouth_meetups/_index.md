## The Rat's Mouth Austrian Economics Meetup ##

Austrian Economics is not the economics of the country of Austria, and you don't need to go to Austria to learn about it - in fact Austrian Economics is right here in South Florida!

Austrian Economics is about the economics of real people making economic decisions in the real world. It is called Austrian because many of the first Austrian economists, like Menger, Böhm-Bawerk, and Ludwig von Mises, were from Austria. But Austrian Economics is now taught and practiced all over the world.

If you are not familiar with Austrian Economics or Ludwig von Mises, you can get a quick overview [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_school). Please also check out the [Ludwig von Mises Institute](http://mises.org/), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.

Because every human being acts in economic ways every day, learning about economics can not only help you to understand about the prosperity - or lack of prosperity - of your country, state, and city, but it can also help you become more prosperous in your own personal life. And because economics has influenced almost everything that people and nations have done in the past and do today, along with economic topics we also look at history, current events, and personal skills that you can use to better your life.

Our get-togethers are open to anyone interested in learning more about liberty, free markets, sound money and peace. Please join us.
