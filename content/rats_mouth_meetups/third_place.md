"Some people think that we Austrians meet in a pub because we are not serious people and that our meetups are just an excuse to drink (like we need an excuse to drink - we live in the most violent and corrupt police state in history). They say that our discussions are many times frivolous, sometimes loud and argumentative, and there are too many interruptions and profane stories that don't pertain to the topic. They say these meetups are a waste of time, and they are morally questionable besides!
 
 Perhaps they are right - maybe we should meet in a church or an office building. Or a public library. Or meet at a nice hotel and use their modern conference facilities. We should have well known speakers delivering lengthy speeches to attentive audiences. This would attract the right kind of serious, important, sober people who have both the intelligence and the means to promote the ideas of free markets and liberty. This has seemed to work very well in our country so far.

 Or is it possible there is a method to our madness?
 
 Nah. You were right the first time - we just needed an excuse to drink."

This week we will be talking about what Ray Oldenberg calls "the third place", which is one of the pillars of society, of rest and relaxation, where people meet that is neither work nor home. What are they? What purpose do they serve, exactly? Where are the great good places now?
