The end is near! At least, that's what I've always been told as a kid. Whether it's the Rapture, Y2K, global thermonuclear warfare, climate change, the plague, super-volcanoes, meteors, Cat 5 hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes or the inevitable collapse of the debt bubble, hard times are ahead, especially since we can never predict precisely when disaster will strike. 

This week we're gonna talk about disasters and disaster-preparedness, from the zombie apocalypse to the dollar collapse to our next hurricane. We'll discuss online advice for dealing with various calamities, and make and compare our own plans for each disaster.
