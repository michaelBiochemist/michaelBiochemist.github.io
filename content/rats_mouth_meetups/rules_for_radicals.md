# The economics of Power part 1 #

To the extent that the state governs our interactions, it sets us into a power struggle against our neighbors. Since we are but a small and weak minority, it's in our best interest to understand the power tactics of the aristocracy, and of the demos. Hell, if we're lucky, maybe we can discover some strategies to greater influence that we can adapt for ourselves.  

This week we're going to look at the book Rules for Radicals by Saul Alinsky. We'll go over the rules themselves, how they work, and how they relate to our counterparts on the left. What's more, we'll count how the present day examples we can find. The person with the most valid suggestions gets a free drink!
