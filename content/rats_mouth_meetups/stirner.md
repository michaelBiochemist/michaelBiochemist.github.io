“Whoever will be free must make himself free. Freedom is no fairy gift to fall into a man's lap. What is freedom? To have the will to be responsible for one's self.”
― Max Stirner 


There was a philosopher few have heard of, who influenced Neitzche and expounded radical egoism. His name was Max Stirner. The egoism he promoted even applied to the idea that ideas are meant to serve the individual. People who stake their lives on the state, the religion, or even property rights, are serving an idea, and have become possessed by a spook of the mind. 

“He who is infatuated with Man leaves persons out of account so far as that infatuation extends, and floats in an ideal, sacred interest. Man, you see, is not a person, but an ideal, a spook.”
― Max Stirner 

Also, if we have time we'll cover how this applies to economics, in the form of the Austrian idea of Methodological individualism.
