This week we look at mainstream economics, including both Neo-Keynesian & Neoclassical Economics.
 
 Economics is full of mathematics nowadays, and economists are trained to create economic models that accurately reflect economic activity in the real world. The results of all this econometric modeling are things like financial derivatives, economic stimuli, and corporate bailouts. I know its hard to believe, but economists actually are paid big money to do this kind of work!
