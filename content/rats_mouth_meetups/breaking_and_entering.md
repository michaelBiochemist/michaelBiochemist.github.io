Sometimes freedom means going where you're not supposed to go, or doing business in a place where men in fancy suits say you have no business entering. This very special meetup we will be discussing the locks that constrain us and how to get around them. 

Tonight, I will teach you how to pick locks. Bring cash, and you will be going home with a very special souvenir.
