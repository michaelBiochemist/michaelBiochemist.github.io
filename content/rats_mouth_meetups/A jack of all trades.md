"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects."
 — Robert Heinlein

" I'm not sure of the year, but I guess I was in my early twenties when I was reminded (once again) to keep my big fat mouth shut. It was in a restaurant in New Orleans, and the food was incredible, the booze was on the company card, and the conversation was lively. Soon I was foolishly expounding on the intersection of Koine Greek and Aramaic in the Hellenistic era, how I built my own computer, the advantage of being left-handed, especially with the parry and riposte in fencing, why actuarial calculations should be done on a computer spreadsheet instead of on paper, the tyranny of equal tempered tuning, and, of course, why central banks will destroy civilization. Along with the chuckles and eye rolls someone said, "you are quite the Renaissance man!" This was not intended as a compliment.
 
 Nowadays everyone is trained to be a specialist, and generalists are often considered dilettantes, Jacks/Janes of All Trades and Masters of None, amateurs or dabblers, and not "serious" about a trade or craft. Around 700 years ago however, developing skills in numerous disciplines, including philosophy, math and science, languages, art, and music, and martial arts was considered the ideal. Many believe that the Italian Renaissance was responsible for the introduction of scientific reasoning and the beginning of technological advancement as well as the precursor to the industrial revolution. And they certainly seemed to enjoy both learning and life!
 
 There are many good reasons to become a polymath, particularly in a world that has for the most part lost the ability to think outside very narrow categories. Polymaths are the best at problem solving, are incredibly creative and inventive, and, they have more than once changed the course of history. Humans naturally are generalists, and with study and discipline, you too can be the most interesting man or woman in the world."
— Niklas Ludwig
