"Let us take a view of industry in general, as affected by this circumstance. The window being broken, the glazier's trade is encouraged to the amount of six francs; this is that which is seen. If the window had not been broken, the shoemaker's trade (or some other) would have been encouraged to the amount of six francs; this is that which is not seen. "

This week we will look at the broken window fallacy, and the continuing obsession with the public, and with public-facing economists, with the seen at the expense of the unseen.
