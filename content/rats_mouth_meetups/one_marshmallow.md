This week we're gonna talk about a key building block in all of human civilization, delayed gratification. Every machine ever built, every piece of capital ever accumulated, is the result of resources set aside, instead of consuming them. And, well, as above so below, this trait is a better predictor of grades in school than IQ, and goes on to predict success in life.  

So this week we'll explore the effects of deferred gratification for both individuals and society, and explore a few ways to expand our own willpower!
