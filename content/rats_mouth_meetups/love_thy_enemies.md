"You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor[a] and hate your enemy.’ But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect."

This week we'll be looking at Christ's injunction to love thy enemies. As it turns out, both the buddhists and Stoics encourage forgiveness of one's enemies as well. Is there more to this, or is god just telling you to roll over and be a weak person?

Let's find out on Monday!
