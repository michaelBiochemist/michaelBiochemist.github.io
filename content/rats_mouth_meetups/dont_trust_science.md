We're often told that scientific knowledge consists of a cabal of secret masterminds that come to a concensus, and tell us plebs how the world really works. With the magic of their chief artifacts "peer review" and "staticics", they earn the position to tell us true from false and it is our job to merely believe them. Thus especially when a politician or activist says "The science is settled!" 

But what if it's not all polish and roses? I'd like to put forth the argument that academia is not quite so pristine. That perhaps, as a friend who'd gone to graduate school seems to suggest, that academia is at least as messy and bumbling as the rest of life.

Question Everything.
