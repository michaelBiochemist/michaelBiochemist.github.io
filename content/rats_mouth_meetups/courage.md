The fear response is hard-wired in humans. And not just humans, it seems to be wired in the brain stem of practically every mammal, reptiles, and even very simple living things. This response is necessary for survival in nature. But in many cases, fear is triggered when there is no fear, so we spend a good deal of time responding to false alarms.
 
 Not only that, we create our own fears in our minds, even when there is no outside stimulus. When humans do this often, they used to be called neurotics - now we just call them typical Americans. Just take your Prozac and you'll be fine.
 
 Humans have survived and thrived in a dangerous world for thousands of years, and have learned how to manage their anxieties and take action despite their fears. In fact one of the ways humans evolved from being prey to being the apex predator (for now), is by learning to manage fear. But our modern culture, particularly in the USA, seems to be designed to exaggerate and promote fear, and humanity seems to be devolving once again into prey.
 
 If you don't like the idea of being the next meal of another apex predator, or being just another domesticated herd animal responding to your shepherd's stick and his dog's bark and bite, you will need to learn to manage and overcome your fears. Fortunately, you can learn how to do this, and the more you face your fears and act in the face of danger, the better you get at it.
 
 What danger did you confront and overcome this week?

Heads up, this week we will be meeting at an undisclosed location (starts with an "A"). Please reach out to me if you don't know where to go.
