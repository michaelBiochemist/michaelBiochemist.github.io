Ever get in a fight so ugly that you wish someone would mediate it using hand-puppets?

This week we will talk about non-violent communication, the communication approach created and taught by Marshall Rosenberg that not only resolves long standing disputes between couples, helps children get along with their parents and the world, but also has been used in disputes with warring clans, where 100 people had been killed. 

Learning this may also change the way you interact with yourself. It has for me. And yes, he does illustrate his concepts using hand puppets.
