As you probably already know, free speech has been under attack in the west for the last several years. 

Saying the wrong thing in a university could get you fired, or worse, set the above guys after you. Saying the politically incorrect thing on the internet could get you banned from any or all of the major social network platforms. The internet was not always this way. It used to be a wild west of separate websites, services and formus, where people of various pseudonyms could say whatever they pleased without physical risk, and without the fear of shadowbanning. This week, let's talk about how to revive those happy times.
