This week we will be talking about the newest hot-to-trot currency, bitcoin! (Also it's related cryptocurrencies). Is bitcoin money? How can we trust it if it's not "backed" by anything? How did we live so long on fiat?

All these questions and more will be addressed this monday. Hope to see you there!
