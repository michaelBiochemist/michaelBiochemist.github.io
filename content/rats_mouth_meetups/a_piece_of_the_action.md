This week we're going to talk about Mercantilism, or for the more modern term, Protectionism, or, those lovely lovely steel tariffs that you're not allowed to criticize lest you be labelled as unpatriotic. No you America haters, you should love all taxes. 

But in all seriousness, Mercantilism is an old philosophy. We'll look at the different permutations it's take over time, and we'll answer the question: "Is there anything else to Protectionism, or is it just politicians who want a piece of the action?"
