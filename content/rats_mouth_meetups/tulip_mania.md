What's the most money you're willing to spend on a single flower? Is it $1, $10, $100, $1,000, or perhaps $1 million? This week we are going to talk about one of the oldest known examples of the boom bust cycle: Tulip Mania. 

This is often cited by economists as the dangers of rampant speculation, particularly the speculation of an unhampered market, but is this the true lesson of Tulip Mania? Here I will make the argument that Bitcoin is in fact a great deal like tulip mania, but NOT in the way that Peter Schiff suggests. I will attempt to tie this into the larger topics of the role of speculation in emerging industries, and on the economic value of art. Let's see what we can learn this Monday!
