Censorship from big tech continues to ramp up, and privacy continues to be invaded. But "count your blessings" our masters say. "Think of the Iranians. And of the poor citizens of countries like Iran." The masters have a point. We SHOULD think of the poor people living in those evil and repressive countries, and see what tools they (and the journalists and spies living there) to circumvent censorship.

This week we'll be talking about one of these technologies. One of the most powerful, and widely used tools throughout the world. It's created the platform for billionaires and scandals. All because it wraps your input through layers of encryption, like the layers of an onion.
