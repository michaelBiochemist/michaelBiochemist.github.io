Have you ever found something so compelling, that you just had to do it, again and again and again and again and again?

This week we will be looking at the psychology, neuroscience, and economics of addiction, and take a look at the special little drug behind it all, dopamine. 

What makes some things addictive? How bad is it to be addicted to something if you can get away with it? Are addictions to non-drug related behaviour like video games/gambling or sex valid addictions, even when there's no substance abuse?

Just how much money is there to be made in the addictive substances market? And how can we free ourselves from the legal drug-peddlers trying to take over our dopamine receptors?

All this and more, this Monday!

Be there or be a crackhead.
