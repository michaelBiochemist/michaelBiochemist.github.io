This week we'll look at market prices, or why, to some people, everything is worth $420. (The meetup description, however, is free!)

We'll look at direct exchange and the difficulties of barter, and then briefly look at money as an indirect exchange mechanism. Then we will look at how prices arise in voluntary trade.

Come On Down!
