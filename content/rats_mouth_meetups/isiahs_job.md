My fellow economists. I can imagine the first time you learned about the business cycle. Once you saw it, you were awed by how clear, just how simple it truly is, and then you thought "If only everyone knew! Then people wouldn't allow this shit to continue!" You were elated at the possibility that your words could open someone's eyes, share your own clarity with them, and then together, perhaps, lift the fog of ignorance that covers the world. ... And then you made the mistake of trying to communicate it with someone else. 

At first you blamed their failure to accept your explanation as your failure to communicate it. So you hone your skills. You rework your arguments, and you try again. Eventually you learn that it's not your argument that's stopping them, but something within your friend refuses to see the facts you laid bare. You start to wonder if knowledge of economics is the curse of Cassandra: the more you know the less people will believe you. How would you feel now if i asked you to proudly proclaim your convictions? How would you feel if i asked you to stand at the public square tub-thumping? Would you feel silly?  

This week we're gonna embrace our inner disdain for the plebs and talk about Isiah's job, by Albert Jay Nock. It talks about the story of Isiah the prophet, sent by god to warn the city that if they continue in their sinful ways God will bring doom upon them. God commands this of Isiah even after telling Isiah that he will be publicly mocked and ignored, and that the city will not improve and God will still destroy it. I contend that God knows something that we don't. 

To whom Isiah is REALLY speaking when he's tub-thumping?
Fuck the normies. Fuck the plebs.
