You are not alone. You share a body with an estimated 40 trillion (some estimates as high as 100 trillion) bacterial and fungal cells. This week we'll be talking about the microbiome, and especially the health implications of having a well-balanced microbiome. 

This meetup will be hosted at my new apartment, so please text me and i'll send you the address. We also need the RSVP to know how much we need to cook.
