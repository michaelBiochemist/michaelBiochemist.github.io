Few things are more reliable than the knowledge that the sun will shine tomorrow, but nowadays we tend to rely far more on indoor lighting, television/computer screens, and air conditioning. This hurts us more than we know, as the sun is a source of vital nutrients that prevent myopia, rickets, bad sleep, bad moods, and more. 

This week we will be looking at the positive effects of sunlight, the negative effects of using only indoor lighting (suck it, Edison!), and how we can get the most out of both.
