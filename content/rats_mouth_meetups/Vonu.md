During the earliest years of the libertarian movement, as the party was beginning to form and the mainstream of libertarian thought and effort to gain a political advantage to persuade the masses, other thinkers sought a different path. Likely inspired by Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, where the characters overthrow the government by "going Galt", two new approaches to freedom, Samuel Konkin's Agorism and Reyo's VONU, were conceived. 

We covered agorism in a previous meetup. Monday, we will talk about Vonu, a portmanteau of "VOluntary, Not VUnerable", and is a strategy designed to make it as difficult as possible for the government to oppress you personally, even if you don't have any like-minded friends who want to help (which Agorism relies on).
