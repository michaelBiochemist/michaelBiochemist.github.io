I know some of you are reading this description and thinking "No-one needs to teach me how to breathe. I know how to breathe. I'm breathing right now." And while we consider ourselves as highly experienced in breathing, few of us have spent time consciously analysing our breathing, and trying different breathwork. Those who have, will tell us that not breathing exclusively through our mouths is only the first step. 

This week we'll be looking at techniques for breathing and meditation. Such tools can be a way to calm the mind, to energize the body, or even to do superhuman feats. For those of us still struggling with that first step, I'll try to show you how much territory there is to explore, and the many gifts it can offer.
