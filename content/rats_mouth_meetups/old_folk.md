"And Jared lived an hundred six and two years, and begat Enoch. And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years and begat sons and daughters."
"And Enoch lived sixty and five years and begat Methuselah. And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
"And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech: And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters."
"And Lamech -- Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years and begat a son: And he called his name Noah."

Aging is a curse that has plagued humans for as long as we've existed, and has, until recently, been inevitable. After the last fifty years our mastery of molecular biology, genetics and research into the mechanisms of aging is starting to bear fruit, and scientist Aubrey De Grey has proposed an approach to anti-aging research that if achieved will allow us to reverse the effects of aging and maintain a perpetual youth, or at least achieve a four-digit lifespan. This week we will investigate De Grey's claims, and they are worth investigating, because everyone to sit at our table deserves to sit among the Very Old Folk. And also to see old age not as something to survive, but as an opportunity for a grand adventure. 

"And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year of Noah's life, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry."
