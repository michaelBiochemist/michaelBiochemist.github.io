This week we will talk about astrology, psychics, personality tests and more. In case you hadn't noticed, horoscopes are big business. WE will attempt to answer the question, "is this all just hokum, or is there something more to this? ... Specifically, is there a skill that I could apply in my own life to become more influential or charismatic, maybe even a millionaire?"  

So come on down this monday and we'll talk about the fine art of cold reading. With it, you can impress crows, imitate dead people, and perhaps even tell a young lady her future. Please join us. You will notice that this week we'll meet on Wednesday. That's because Mercury is in retrograde.
